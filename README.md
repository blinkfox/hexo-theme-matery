This theme adds support for the `emoji` emoticon, using the Hexo plugin for [hexo-filter-github-emojis] (https://npm.taobao.org/package/hexo-filter-github-emojis) to support The generation of the `emoji` expression, the corresponding `markdown emoji` syntax (`::`, for example: `:smile:`) is converted into a `emoji` expression that jumps.

  customEmojis:
```

Execute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then  you can see the expression you wrote in the `emoji` grammar in the corresponding position in the article.


### Code highlight

Hexo theme uses Hexo's plugin[hexo-prism-plugin](https://github.com/ele828/hexo-prism-plugin) to show the code highlight instead of its own theme.The Installation commands are as follows:

```bash
npm i -S hexo-prism-plugin

### Translate Chinese Link to Pinyin (Optional)

Defualt permalinks of Hexo will include Chinese if your atrticle's title is Chinese.But it's adverse to `SEO`,and `gitment` comments don't suport Chinese Link as well.We can use the [hexo-permalink-pinyin](https://github.com/viko16/hexo-permalink-pinyin) of Hexo plugin to generate permalinks of Chinese Pinyin  when generating posts.

Installation commands are as follows：

```bash
npm i hexo-permalink-pinyin --save
```

Add such configurations in `_config.yml` file of  Hexo:

```yaml
permalink_pinyin:
  enable: true
  separator: '-' # default: '-'
```

> **Note*:[hexo-abbrlink](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink) can genarate non-Chinese link in addtion to this plugin.

### Post word count statistics plugin (Optional)

If you want to display the post word count and reading time information in the post detail page, you can install the [hexo-wordcount](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount) plugin.

Installation commands are as follows：

```bash
npm i --save hexo-wordcount
```

Then just activate the following configuration items in the theme `_config.yml` file:

  postWordCount: true
  min2read: true
  totalCount: true
```

  order_by: -date
```

Execute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the `atom.xml` file in the `public` folder, indicating that you have successfully installed.

### Modify website footer

Website footer may need to be customized, and it is not convenient to make configuration information, So need to modify and process it by yourself. The changes are in the `/layout/_partial/footer.ejs` file, including the site, the theme used, the amount of traffic and so on.

### Modify social links

In the theme `_config.yml` file, the configuration of `QQ`, `GitHub` and mailbox is supported by default. In the `/layout/_partial/social-link.ejs` file of the theme, you can add or modify the social link address as you need. To add a link, please refer to the following code:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/blinkfox" class="tooltipped" target="_blank" data-tooltip="访问我的GitHub" data-position="top" data-delay="50">
    <i class="fa fa-github"></i>
</a>

- Wechat: `fa-wechat`
- QQ: `fa-qq`

> **Note**: The version of `Font Awesome` is `4.7.0`.

### Configure music player (optional)

To support music playing, you must activate the file of music playing configuration and music data.

First, create a new `musics.json` file in the `_data` directory (new if you don't have one) of your blog's `source` directory. The contents of the file are as follows:

```json
[{
	"name": "五月雨变奏电音",
	"artist": "AnimeVibe",
	"url": "http://xxx.com/music1.mp3",
	"cover": "http://xxx.com/music-cover1.png"
}, {
	"name": "Take me hand",
	"artist": "DAISHI DANCE,Cecile Corbel",
	"url": "/medias/music/music2.mp3",
	"cover": "/medias/music/cover2.png"
}, {
	"name": "Shape of You",
	"artist": "J.Fla",
	"url": "http://xxx.com/music3.mp3",
	"cover": "http://xxx.com/music-cover3.png"
}]
```

> **Note**: The properties in the above JSON: `name`, `artist`, `url`, `cover` indicate the name of the music, the author, the music file address, and the music cover, respectively.

Then, activate the configuration in the theme's `_config.yml` configuration file:

# Whether to display the musics.
music:
  enable: true
  showTitle: false
  title: Listen to music
  fixed: false # enable fixed mode

  preload: 'auto' # values: 'none', 'metadata', 'auto'
  volume: 0.7 # default volume, notice that player will remember user setting, default volume will not work after user set volume themselves
  listFolded: false # indicate whether list should folded at first
  listMaxHeight: # list max height
```

## Post Front-matter

### Detailed Front-matter options

Everything in the Front-matter option is **not required**. But I still recommend at least filling in the values of `title` and `date`.

| Options   | Defaults              | Description                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title      | Markdown's file title | Post title, it is highly recommended to fill in this option |
| date       | Date and time when the file created | Publish time, it is highly recommended to fill in this option, and it is best to ensure that it is globally unique |
| author     | `author` in root `_config.yml` | Post author                                    |
| img        | a value in `featureImages`  | Post feature image，For exampl: `http://xxx.com/xxx.jpg` |
| top        | `true`                      | Recommended post (whether the post is topped), if the `top` value is `true`, it will be recommended as a homepage post. |
| cover      | `false`                     | The `v1.0.2` version is added to indicate whether the post needs to be added to the homepage carousel cover. |
| coverImg   | null                        | The new version of `v1.0.2` indicates that the post needs to display the image path on the cover of the homepage. If not, the default image of the post is used by default. |
| password   | null                        | The post read the password. If you want to set the reading verification password for the article, you can set the value of `password`, which must be encrypted with `SHA256` to prevent others from seeing it. The premise is that the `verifyPassword` option is activated in the theme's `config.yml` |
| toc        | `true`                      | Whether TOC is turned on or not, you can turn off the TOC function for an article. The premise is that the `toc` option is activated in the theme's `config.yml` |
| mathjax    | `false`                     | Whether to enable math formula support, whether this article starts `mathjax`, and you need to open it in the theme `_config.yml` file. |
| summary    | null                        | Post summary, custom post summary content, if the attribute has a value, the post card summary will display the text, otherwise the program will automatically intercept part of the article as a summary |
| categories | null                        | Article classification, the classification of this topic represents a macroscopically large classification, only one article is recommended for one classification. |
| tags       | null                        | Post label, a post can have multiple labels |
| reprintPolicy       | cc_by                        | Post reprint policy, value could be one of cc_by, cc_by_nd, cc_by_sa, cc_by_nc, cc_by_nc_nd, cc_by_nc_sa, cc0, noreprint and pay |

> **Note**: 
> 1. post's featured piature will take remainder if not writing the `img` property,and chose the featured picture of theme to let all of post's picture **have their own characteristics**.
> 2. The value of `date` should try to ensure that each article is unique, because `Gitalk` and `Gitment` recognize `id` in this topic are uniquely identified by the value of `date`.
> 3. If you want to set the ability to read the verification password for the article, you should not only set the value of the password with SHA256 encryption in Front-matter, but also activate the configuration in the theme `_config.yml`.
> 4. you can define reprint policy for a single article in the front-matter of the specific md file using this key: reprintPolicy

The following are examples of the post's `Front-matter`.

### The simplest example

```yaml
---
title: typora-vue-theme Theme introduction
date: 2018-09-07 09:25:00

```

### The most comprehensive example

## Custom modification

You can modify some custom modification in `_config.yml` as follows:

- [Busuanzi Statistics](http://busuanzi.ibruce.info/) And Google Analytics
- The map of default featured pictures. The theme will take remainde according to `hashcode` of post title if the post dose not set featured piactures.

**I think everyone should have their own style and feature of blog**。if you are not satisfiled with functions and theme color,you can modify by yourself,and more free functions and deatil need to be modified by modify source code when it is hard to be finished in `_config.yml`.

### modeing theme color

Search `.bg-color` to modify background color in `/source/css/matery.css` in theme file：

```css
/* The overall background color, including navigation, mobile navigation, footer, tab, etc.. */
.bg-color {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #4cbf30 0%, #0f9d58 100%);
}

@-webkit-keyframes rainbow {
   /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}

@keyframes rainbow {
    /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}
```

### Modify banner picture and post's featured pictures

You can change `banner` pictures in `/source/medias/banner` as you like .Theme code can switch  dynamically every day and just need 7 pictures.If you master `JavaScript`,you can change it to your favorite swithing logic,such as Random switching.The code of switching `banner`is in `<script></script>` of `/layout/_partial/bg-cover-content.ejs`file.

```javascript
$('.bg-cover').css('background-image', 'url(/medias/banner/' + new Date().getDay() + '.jpg)');
```

There are 24 featured pictures in `/source/medias/featureimages`,you can add or delete,and modify it in `_config.yml` at the sametime.
