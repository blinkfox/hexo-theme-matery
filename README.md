```

### Menu navigation configuration

#### Configure the name of the basic menu navigation, path url and icon icon.

1. The menu navigation name can be Chinese or English (eg: `Index` or `Home`)
2. Icon icon can be found in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)

```yaml
menu:
  Index:
    url: /
    icon: fas fa-home
  Tags:
    url: /tags
    icon: fas fa-tags
  Categories:
    url: /categories
    icon: fas fa-bookmark
  Archives:
    url: /archives
    icon: fas fa-archive
  About:
    url: /about
    icon: fas fa-user-circle
  Friends:
    url: /friends
    icon: fas fa-address-book
```

#### Secondary menu configuration method

If you need a secondary menu, you can do the following on the basis of the original basic menu navigation.

1. Add the `children` keyword to the first level menu that needs to add a secondary menu (eg: add `children` under the `About` menu)
2. Create a secondary menu name, path url and icon icon under `children`.
3. Note that each secondary menu module must be preceded by `-`.
4. Note the indentation format.

```yaml
menu:
  Index:
    url: /
    icon: fas fa-home
  Tags:
    url: /tags
    icon: fas fa-tags
  Categories:
    url: /categories
    icon: fas fa-bookmark

    url: /archives
    icon: fas fa-archive

        icon: fas fa-music
      - name: Movies
        url: /movies
        icon: fas fa-film
      - name: Books
        url: /books
        icon: fas fa-book
      - name: Galleries
        url: /galleries
        icon: fas fa-image
```

### Code highlight

Hexo theme uses Hexo's plugin [hexo-prism-plugin](https://github.com/ele828/hexo-prism-plugin) to show the code highlight instead of its own theme.The Installation commands are as follows:

```bash
npm i -S hexo-prism-plugin
```

Then,modify the value of `highlight.enable` to `false` in `_config.yml` file of Hexo root folder, and add the configuration of `prism` plugin as follows:

```yaml
highlight:
  enable: false

prism_plugin:
  mode: 'preprocess'    # realtime/preprocess
  theme: 'tomorrow'
  line_number: false    # default false
  custom_css:
```

### Search

The theme uses the Hexo plugin [hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-generator-search) to search the content,and the Installation commands are as follows:

```bash
npm install hexo-generator-search --save
```

Add configuration of `_config.yml` file in Hexo root folder as follows：

```yaml
search:
  path: search.xml
  field: post
```

### Translate Chinese Link to Pinyin (Recommend)

Defualt permalinks of Hexo will include Chinese if your atrticle's title is Chinese. But it's adverse to `SEO`, and `gitment` comments don't suport Chinese Link as well. We can use the [hexo-permalink-pinyin](https://github.com/viko16/hexo-permalink-pinyin) of Hexo plugin to generate permalinks of Chinese Pinyin when generating posts.

Installation commands are as follows：

```bash
npm i hexo-permalink-pinyin --save
```

Add such configurations in `_config.yml` file of Hexo:

```yaml
permalink_pinyin:
  enable: true
  separator: '-' # default: '-'
```

> **Note**: [hexo-abbrlink](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink) can genarate non-Chinese link in addtion to this plugin.

### Post word count statistics plugin (Recommend)

If you want to display the post word count and reading time information in the post detail page, you can install the [hexo-wordcount](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount) plugin.

Installation commands are as follows：

```bash
npm i --save hexo-wordcount
```

Then just activate the following configuration items in the theme `_config.yml` file:

```yaml
postInfo:
  date: true
  update: false
  wordCount: false # set true.
  totalCount: false # set true.
  min2read: false # set true.
  readCount: false # set true.
```

### Add emoji support (Optional)

This theme adds support for the `emoji` emoticon, using the Hexo plugin for [hexo-filter-github-emojis](https://npm.taobao.org/package/hexo-filter-github-emojis) to support the generation of the `emoji` expression, the corresponding `markdown emoji` syntax (`::`, for example: `:smile:`) is converted into a `emoji` expression that jumps. The installation command is as follows:

```bash
npm install hexo-filter-github-emojis --save
```

Add configuration of `_config.yml` file in Hexo root folder as follows：

```yaml
githubEmojis:
  enable: true
  className: github-emoji
  inject: true
  styles:
  customEmojis:
```

Execute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the expression you wrote in the `emoji` grammar in the corresponding position in the article.

### Add RSS feed support (Optional)

The theme uses the Hexo plugin [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to support `RSS` feed , and the Installation commands are as follows:

```bash
npm install hexo-generator-feed --save
```

Add configuration of `_config.yml` file in Hexo root folder as follows：

```yaml
feed:
  type: atom
  path: atom.xml
  limit: 20
  hub:
  content:
  content_limit: 140
  content_limit_delim: ' '
  order_by: -date
```

Execute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the `atom.xml` file in the `public` folder, indicating that you have successfully installed.

### [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/) online chat (Optional)

Go to the official website of [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/), register and get the `app_id`. Fill the `app_id` into the the theme `_config.yml` file.

### [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/) online chat (Optional)

Go to the official website of [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/), register and get the `Public Key`. Fill the `Public Key` into the the theme `_config.yml` file.

### Modify website footer

Website footer may need to be customized, and it is not convenient to make configuration information, So need to modify and process it by yourself. The changes are in the `/layout/_partial/footer.ejs` file, including the site, the theme used, the amount of traffic and so on.

### Modify social links

In the theme `_config.yml` file, the configurations of `QQ`, `GitHub` and mailbox and more are supported by default. In the `/layout/_partial/social-link.ejs` file of the theme, you can add or modify the social link address as you need. To add a link, please refer to the following code:

```html
<% if (theme.socialLink.github) { %>
    <a href="<%= theme.socialLink.github %>" class="tooltipped" target="_blank" data-tooltip="访问我的GitHub" data-position="top" data-delay="50">
        <i class="fab fa-github"></i>
    </a>
<% } %>
```

You can search social icon such as `fab fa-github` in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons). There are common social icons you can reference:

## Post Front-matter

### Detailed Front-matter options

Everything in the Front-matter option is **not required**. But I still recommend at least filling in the values of `title` and `date`.

| Options   | Defaults              | Description                                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title      | Markdown's file title | Post title, it is highly recommended to fill in this option |
| date       | Date and time when the file created | Publish time, it is highly recommended to fill in this option, and it is best to ensure that it is globally unique |
| author     | `author` in root `_config.yml` | Post author                                    |
| img        | a value in `featureImages`  | Post feature image，For exampl: `http://xxx.com/xxx.jpg` |
| top        | `true`                      | Recommended post (whether the post is topped), if the `top` value is `true`, it will be recommended as a homepage post. |
| cover      | `false`                     | The `v1.0.2` version is added to indicate whether the post needs to be added to the homepage carousel cover. |
| coverImg   | null                        | The new version of `v1.0.2` indicates that the post needs to display the image path on the cover of the homepage. If not, the default image of the post is used by default. |
| password   | null                        | The post read the password. If you want to set the reading verification password for the article, you can set the value of `password`, which must be encrypted with `SHA256` to prevent others from seeing it. The premise is that the `verifyPassword` option is activated in the theme's `config.yml` |
| toc        | `true`                      | Whether TOC is turned on or not, you can turn off the TOC function for an article. The premise is that the `toc` option is activated in the theme's `config.yml` |
| mathjax    | `false`                     | Whether to enable math formula support, whether this article starts `mathjax`, and you need to open it in the theme `_config.yml` file. |
| summary    | null                        | Post summary, custom post summary content, if the attribute has a value, the post card summary will display the text, otherwise the program will automatically intercept part of the article as a summary |
| categories | null                        | Article classification, the classification of this topic represents a macroscopically large classification, only one article is recommended for one classification. |
| tags       | null                        | Post label, a post can have multiple labels |
| keywords   | Post Title                  | Post key Words With SEO                               |
| reprintPolicy       | cc_by              | Post reprint policy, value could be one of cc_by, cc_by_nd, cc_by_sa, cc_by_nc, cc_by_nc_nd, cc_by_nc_sa, cc0, noreprint and pay |

> **Note**: 
> 1. post's featured piature will take remainder if not writing the `img` property,and chose the featured picture of theme to let all of post's picture **have their own characteristics**.
> 2. The value of `date` should try to ensure that each article is unique, because `Gitalk` and `Gitment` recognize `id` in this topic are uniquely identified by the value of `date`.
> 3. If you want to set the ability to read the verification password for the article, you should not only set the value of the password with SHA256 encryption in Front-matter, but also activate the configuration in the theme `_config.yml`.
> 4. you can define reprint policy for a single article in the front-matter of the specific md file using this key: reprintPolicy

The following are examples of the post's `Front-matter`.

### The simplest example

```yaml
---
title: typora-vue-theme Theme introduction
date: 2018-09-07 09:25:00

## Custom modification

You can modify some custom modification in `_config.yml` as follows:

- Menu

- My Projects

- Gitalk, Gitment, Valine and Disqus
- [Busuanzi Statistics](http://busuanzi.ibruce.info/) And Google Analytics
- The map of default featured pictures. The theme will take remainde according to `hashcode` of post title if the post dose not set featured piactures.

**I think everyone should have their own style and feature of blog**。if you are not satisfiled with functions and theme color,you can modify by yourself,and more free functions and deatil need to be modified by modify source code when it is hard to be finished in `_config.yml`.

### modeing theme color

Search `.bg-color` to modify background color in `/source/css/matery.css` in theme file：

```css
/* The overall background color, including navigation, mobile navigation, footer, tab, etc.. */
.bg-color {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #4cbf30 0%, #0f9d58 100%);
}

@-webkit-keyframes rainbow {
   /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}

@keyframes rainbow {
    /* Dynamically switch background colors. */
}
```

### Modify banner picture and post's featured pictures

You can change `banner` pictures in `/source/medias/banner` as you like .Theme code can switch  dynamically every day and just need 7 pictures.If you master `JavaScript`,you can change it to your favorite swithing logic,such as Random switching.The code of switching `banner`is in `<script></script>` of `/layout/_partial/bg-cover-content.ejs`file.

```javascript
$('.bg-cover').css('background-image', 'url(/medias/banner/' + new Date().getDay() + '.jpg)');
```

There are 24 featured pictures in `/source/medias/featureimages`,you can add or delete,and modify it in `_config.yml` at the sametime.
